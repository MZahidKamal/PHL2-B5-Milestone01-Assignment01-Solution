# What Are Some Differences Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript?

### Interface
Primarily used for objects and classes. It can be extended using the `extends` keyword and supports declaration merging, meaning multiple interfaces with the same name can be defined and merged automatically.

### Type
Type aliases are more flexible. They can define primitives, unions, intersections, and more. However, they do not support declaration merging.

### Usage Difference
When defining object types with a type alias, the structure declaration is optional, but with an interface, the objectâ€™s structure must be defined. For objects and classes, using an interface is safer and more ideal.

### Example: Using Interface and Type
```typescript
// Example using Type Alias
type Point = {
    x: number;
    y: number;
};
const point1: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
console.log(point1);

// Example using Interface
interface Shape {
    width: number;
    height: number;
}
const shape1: Shape = { width: 30, height: 40 };
console.log(shape1);
```

### What Happened in the Example?
- `type Point` creates a type alias with `x` and `y` properties. The `point1` object follows this type.
- `interface Shape` defines an interface with `width` and `height` properties. The `shape1` object follows this interface.

### What TypeScript Rules/Syntax Did I Learn?
- Use the `type` keyword to create a type alias, e.g., `type Name = { property: type }`.
- Use the `interface` keyword to create an interface, e.g., `interface Name { property: type }`.
- Both types and interfaces can define object structures, but types are more flexible, while interfaces are more structured.
